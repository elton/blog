<ol>
	<li>Create a segue from a button or other control on the source scene to the destination scene. (If youâ€™re presenting the new screen modally, then often the destination will be a Navigation Controller.)</li>
	<li>Give the segue a unique Identifier. (It only has to be unique in the source scene; different scenes can use the same identifier.)</li>
	<li>Create a delegate protocol for the destination scene.</li>
	<li>Call the delegate methods from the Cancel and Done buttons, and at any other point your destination scene needs to communicate with the source scene.</li>
	<li>Make the source scene implement the delegate protocol. It should dismiss the destination view controller when Cancel or Done is pressed.</li>
	<li>Implement prepareForSegue in the source view controller and do destination.delegate = self;.</li>
</ol>
